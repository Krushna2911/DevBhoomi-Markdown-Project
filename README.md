**Uttarakhand is called as a Dev Bhoomi ie land of Gods.** It has a number of temples dating back to thousands of years. The most famous among them are the temples located in the four locations of Badarinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri & Yamunotri, which are collectively referred as Char Dham. Pilgrims from all over India and abroad visit the shrines as Char Dham Yatra. The Char Dham yatra hold great importance and sanctity in Hindu religion. It is said that every Hindu should undertake Char Dham Yatra at least once in a life time & get blessings of gods adorning the shrines.

## Badrinath Mandir

The name of the Badarinath tirtha originates from local word Badari which is a type of a wild berry. It is said that when Lord Vishnu sat in penance in these mountains, His consort Goddess Laxmi took the form of a berry tree and shaded Him from the harsh sun. It is not only the dwelling place of Lord Vishnu Himself but also home to countless pilgrims, saints and sages, who meditate here in search of enlightenment.
> "According to Skand Puran, the idol of Lord Badarinath was recovered by Adiguru Shankaracharya from Narad Kund and was re-enshrined in the 8th century A.D. in this temple.".

According to Hindu Tradition, Badarinath often called as Badari Vishal, was re-established by Adi Shri Shankaracharaya to revieve the lost prestige of Hinduism and to unite nation in one bond. It was built in the ages when Buddhism was spreading in the Himalayan range and there was worry that Hinduism was losing it's importance and glory. So the Adi Sankaracharya took it upon himself to bring back the glory of Hinduism and built temples in the Himalayas for the Hindu Gods of Shiva and Vishnu. The Badarinath temple is one such shrine and is richly infused with sacred accounts from numerous ancient Hindu scriptures. Be it the puranic story of the Pandav brothers, along with Draupadi, going past on their last pilgrimage by ascending the slopes of a peak near Badarinath called Swargarohini or the 'Ascent to Heaven' or the visit by Lord Krishna and other great sages, these are just some of the many tales which we associate with this holy tirtha.
