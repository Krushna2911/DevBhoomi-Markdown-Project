<h1 align="center">Welcome to BHOOMI TOURISM!</h1>

**Uttarakhand is called as a Dev Bhoomi ie land of Gods.** It has a number of temples dating back to thousands of years. The most famous among them are the temples located in the four locations of Badarinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri & Yamunotri, which are collectively referred as Char Dham. Pilgrims from all over India and abroad visit the shrines as Char Dham Yatra. The Char Dham yatra hold great importance and sanctity in Hindu religion. It is said that every Hindu should undertake Char Dham Yatra at least once in a life time & get blessings of gods adorning the shrines.

## Badrinath Mandir

The name of the Badarinath tirtha originates from local word Badari which is a type of a wild berry. It is said that when Lord Vishnu sat in penance in these mountains, His consort Goddess Laxmi took the form of a berry tree and shaded Him from the harsh sun. It is not only the dwelling place of Lord Vishnu Himself but also home to countless pilgrims, saints and sages, who meditate here in search of enlightenment.
> "According to Skand Puran, the idol of Lord Badarinath was recovered by Adiguru Shankaracharya from Narad Kund and was re-enshrined in the 8th century A.D. in this temple.".

According to Hindu Tradition, Badarinath often called as Badari Vishal, was re-established by Adi Shri Shankaracharaya to revieve the lost prestige of Hinduism and to unite nation in one bond. It was built in the ages when Buddhism was spreading in the Himalayan range and there was worry that Hinduism was losing it's importance and glory. So the Adi Sankaracharya took it upon himself to bring back the glory of Hinduism and built temples in the Himalayas for the Hindu Gods of Shiva and Vishnu. The Badarinath temple is one such shrine and is richly infused with sacred accounts from numerous ancient Hindu scriptures. Be it the puranic story of the Pandav brothers, along with Draupadi, going past on their last pilgrimage by ascending the slopes of a peak near Badarinath called Swargarohini or the 'Ascent to Heaven' or the visit by Lord Krishna and other great sages, these are just some of the many tales which we associate with this holy tirtha.

 ## Kedarnath Dham
 There are more than 200 shrines dedicated to Lord Shiva in Chamoli district of Uttarakhand itself, the most important one is Kedarnath. According to legend, the Pandavas after having won over the Kauravas in the Kurukshetra war, felt guilty of having killed their own Kith and Kin and sought blessings of Lord Shiva for redemption. He eluded them repeatedly and while fleeing took refuge at Kedarnath in the form of a bafellow.

On being followed, the Lord dived into the ground, leaving his hump on the surface at Kedarnath. The remaining portions of Lord Shiva appeared at four other places and are worshipped there as his manifestations. The arms of the Lord appeared at Tungnath, the face at Rudranath, the belly at Madmaheshwar and his locks (hair) with head at Kalpeshwar. The Kedarnath and four above mentioned shrines are treated as Panch Kedar (Panch means Five in Sanskrit).

> The Temple at Kedarnath presents an imposing sight, standing in middle of a wide plateau surrounded by lofty snow covered peaks. The temple was originally built in 8th century A.D. by Jagad Guru Adi Shankaracharya and stands adjacent to site of an even earlier temple built by the Pandavas. The inner walls of the assembly hall are decorated with figures of various deities and scenes from mythology. Outside the temple door a large statue of the Nandi Bafellow stands as guard.

Dedicated to Lord Shiva, the Kedarnath temple has exquisite architecture Built of extremely large, heavy and evenly cut grey slabs of stones, it evokes wonder as to how these heavy slabs were moved and handled in the earlier centuries. The temple has a Garbha Griha for worship and a Mandap, apt for assemblies of pilgrims and visitors. A conical rock formation inside the temple is worshipped as Lord Shiva in his Sadashiva form.

Dehradun has the nearest railway station, 171 kms away while Jolly Grant in Dehradun is the nearest airport at a distance of 197 kms.
